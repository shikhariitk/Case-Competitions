# 🌾 MALANG International Business Case Challenge (IBCC) 2025

### Implementing Technological Solutions for Global Sustainable Impact

## Project Overview

**TERRA** is an AgriTech venture focused on **smallholder farmers in Southeast Asia**, delivering **AI, IoT, and satellite-driven climate intelligence** for crop management, sustainability, and market access.
The team’s goal was to **address low technology adoption**, **fragmented data systems**, and **high data acquisition costs** while ensuring scalability and inclusivity.

---

## Problem Statement

Despite high mobile and internet penetration in rural Southeast Asia, **less than 10% of farmers** use AgriTech tools.
Challenges include:

* Limited affordability and awareness
* Complex interfaces
* Data fragmentation and trust issues
* Low farmer literacy and tech confidence

---

## Analysis

### 1. **Farmer Demographics**

* 90% of farmers hold <10 hectares of land
* Education: 65% with primary or lower education
* 95% have mobile phones; 62% have internet

### 2. **Competitor Landscape**

Benchmarked against leading AgriTech players:

* **SatSure**, **CropIn**, **Rikolto**, **Agmatix**
* Evaluated models: B2B SaaS, NGO-driven sustainability, and large-scale AI analytics platforms

### 3. **Market Insights**

* Indonesian rice sector faces droughts, floods, and price volatility
* Government assistance is delayed due to manual processes
* Urgent need for **real-time, localized insights** and data-driven policy support

---

## Solution Framework

### 1. **Digital Ecosystem Design**

* Mobile-first approach (Android App + SMS/IVR/USSD)
* Icon-based UI, multilingual & voice support
* Offline mode and chatbot integration
* Local community WhatsApp groups for training & market updates

### 2. **TERRA Sustainability Index (TSI)**

A quantitative metric for sustainable farming based on:

* Soil preparation
* Machinery emissions
* Waste disposal
* Chemical and manure usage
  **Formula:**
  `TSI = P₁W₁ + P₂W₂ + P₃W₃ + P₄W₄`
  (Weighted system to promote measurable, field-level sustainability)

### 3. **Public–Private Partnerships**

Collaborate with **PISAgro**, a World Economic Forum–aligned consortium with:

* National reach in Indonesia
* Partnerships with Bayer, McKinsey, Nestlé, Unilever
* Access to NGOs, cooperatives, and ministries
